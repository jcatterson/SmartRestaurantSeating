SmartRestaurantSeating
======================
As a host at a restaurant many decisions need to be made in order to both satisfy your customer needs, be fair with server rotations, and maximize capacity utilization.  This application looks to solve this problem.

What does the application contain?
  * Hosting screen: A list of servers with the tables they are assigned.  The number of tables the server has been seated all shift.  Dirty/Clean table indicator that can be toggled.
  * Guest input screen:  A screen to enter guest information.  Such as number of guests, high chairs needed, booth/table preference.
  * Wait List: A screen indicating who is looking to be seated.  Approximate wait time left, and a guess at what table they will be seated at based on the seating times.
